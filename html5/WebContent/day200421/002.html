		Lorem Ipsum is <span>simply dummy text</span> of the printing and typesetting industry. 
		<strong>Lorem</strong> <em>Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
		when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
		It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
		remaining essentially unchanged
